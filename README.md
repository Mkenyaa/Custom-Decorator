# Custom Decorator with Advanced Capabilities

## Overview

This project demonstrates a powerful custom decorator in Python designed to dynamically modify the behavior of class methods based on runtime conditions. The decorator can:

- Intercept method calls
- Modify arguments before the method execution
- Alter the return value of the method
- Change the method's execution flow based on the result

## Features

- **Argument Modification**: Adjusts method arguments before invoking the original method.
- **Return Value Alteration**: Changes the return value of the original method.
- **Conditional Execution Flow**: Modifies the method's execution flow based on runtime conditions and the result of the method call.
- **Decorator Flexibility**: Enables setting conditions to control the decorator's behavior.

## Installation

This project does not require any special installation. Simply clone the repository and ensure you have Python installed on your system.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

## Usage

### Custom Decorator Implementation

The custom decorator is defined with a condition that dictates its behavior. 

### Example Class Using the Decorator

An example class `MyClass` demonstrates how to use the custom decorator:

```python
# Example class using the custom decorator
class MyClass:
    @custom_decorator(condition=True)
    # Method to be decorated
    def my_method(self, x, y):
        return x + y

# Test the decorated method
obj = MyClass()
result = obj.my_method(3, 4)
print("Final result:", result)
```

### Running the Example

To run the example and see the custom decorator in action, execute the following command:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of your Python file containing the above code.

### Expected Output

The expected output of the example is:

```
Modified arguments: [4, 5]
Modified return value: 16
Result is greater than 10!
Final result: 16
```
